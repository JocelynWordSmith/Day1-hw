Day1-hw

Homework for the first day of iron yard classes. This is the first web page I ever built, and I did so the first night of
the first html class I had at the iron yard. The assignment was to make a small bio about ourselves, and I think it 
turned out pretty well considering i made it in a day with zero experience.
